<?php
/*Here, we create a variable that is a string that we will use as the name of the directory that holds the photos*/
$dir = "images";
/*You need to create another variable that will be the directory that the <a> tags will link to. Thus, you will have 2 "image folders" One for your 400wX300h thumbnails and another in this case called "movies" that contains the large images*/
$dir2 = "images/movies";


/*Here, we tell PHP:
IF variable $dir is actually a directory (hence the is_dir function), and if variable $photo = opendir($dir), thus, we are going to open "images" if it is a directory, and we are going to look for SOMETHING. 

now, we have to use a while loop. 

So, we set a variable called $file and we say, while reading the open image directory ("readdir($photo)") is not false, so essentially, if the directory is named images, if it is open, and we are able to read it (this is permission based) OR if this condition IS NOT FALSE, then we need to check the files to see if they are in the right format. We use a regular expression checking the names of the files set within the variable $file, and match the names with the ending or combination of ".jpg". IF ALL THIS HAPPENS,

echo the div for the gallery.

If it isn't, halt and catch fire.  

When coding the div within PHP there are also some considerations to be made.

<div class=\"col-lg-3 col-md-4 col-xs-6 thumb\">
<a class=\"thumbnail\" href=\"$dir/$file\" target=\"_blank\">
<img class=\"img-responsive\" src=\"$dir/$file\" title =\"This is the title of the picture\"alt=\"This is the alt text\">
</a>
</div>
";

First, we have to comment out all "" quotes. Next, we have to set the div according to the bootstrap sizes described in a previous comment. Now, we set the anchor tag's href value to \"$dir/$file\" or more simply, $dir/$file. So, our broswer will seek out the $dir or, the name (string) of the folder with the images, and we add a "/" to basically add $file which will add the name of the files within the folder itself. So, $dir/$file equals images/[image file name]. So, we basically are dynamically changing the href like this, and we do an identical process for the image src within the image tag, so upon click, the user can get that file in a new window, THROUGH the anchor tag.
